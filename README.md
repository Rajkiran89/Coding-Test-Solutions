# Coding-Test-Solutions
 
**Language Used:** Java  

This repository contains solutions to the four coding problems given in the screening test.  
Each problem is solved in a separate Java file inside the `src/` folder.

## Problem List & Files

### **Program_1.java**
A simple calculator that performs:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

**Inputs:**  
- `a` → double  
- `b` → double  
- `type of operation` → String (add, sub, mul, div)

---

### **Program_2.java**
Generates a series of odd numbers up to the given number `a`.

**Example:**  
- Input: `4`  
- Output: `1, 3, 5, 7`

---

### **Program_3.java**
Generates odd numbers only until the highest odd ≤ `a`.

**Example:**  
- Input: `6`  
- Output: `1, 3, 5`

---

### **Program_4.java**
Counts how many numbers in a list are divisible by each number from **1 to 9**.

**Input Example:**  
`[1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]`

**Output:**  
{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
